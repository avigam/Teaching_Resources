I have also been involved in this fundraiser since the beginning. After moving away, it seemed like I was less a part of it. Last year, however; Donna called me up and asked me to help her out. As I am facing medical issues I was concerned about how I would be able to walk around the event. She came up with a plan and she got a golf cart for me to ride in adorned with a huge witch hat on the top of it."
1,img,Jody and I were at the mall in New Orleans shopping for souvenirs. As we walked through the mall we saw a ticket booth that offered Buy One Get One Free on tickets to the Mardi Gras Museum down the road. We had been talking about going to see the museum so the idea of BOGO really appealed to us. We decided to purchase our tickets right then and there. The next bus tour was leaving the mall in 15 minutes so we decided we'd go ahead and get on that tour. We went on the Mardi Gras Museum tour and had a blast.
2,real,"Candace and I sat down next to a tree. We had brought a basket of food because it was a nice day out. In the basket were sandwiches and a couple bottles of tea. We ate the sandwiches while talking about what was happening in our lives. After we finished our meal, we cleaned up and sat next to the tree. We continued to talk, not noticing the time passing. Then during a brief pause, something unexpected happened. Candace leaned in to kiss me. I felt foolish for not realizing before she felt this way. I kissed her back as we sat under the tree."
2,img,I walked up to Jill when she was sitting at her desk at home. I asked her what she was doing. She said she was working on a project. I looked at the desk and saw she was putting a model air plane together. She had paint brushes and paint with her. She was clipping pieces off the runner and snapping them together. I ask her how long she had been working on it. Jill said she started the project a few days ago. I sat down to watch as she continued to work on the model.
3,real,"XT sit on the chair in the office and worked on her project. When I walked into the office, XT asked whether we could have a discussion about the manuscript that needed to be revised. I agreed. XT presented all the reviewers' comment and we started to go through. The reviewers' comments were huge and some were very hard to reply to. Other co-authors on the paper also joined in our discussion. After one hour, we got to agree that the paper should be accepted for publication given all comments could be addressed."
3,img,"Last month, XL visited Quanzhou where I worked. He called me before his arrival and I picked him up at the airport. There was nothing to do after an enjoyable dinner with XL. We discussed what we could do in the evening. It seemed that we did not watch a movie for a long time. We checked the movie list that we could watch at that time. After research online, we found that the Mulan III was a new release and it was a legend. We then went to the cinema."
4,real,"Ariel entered the museum on a hot, Russian day and bolted towards the sculpture section. She recalled that there had been a specific one here, one that was in all of the tourist books and that her professor mentioned all the time in class. When she got to the section, she scanned the room and gasped. There in front of her was 'Crouching Boy' by Michelangelo, a piece she never thought she'd get to see. She stared in wonder for a few moments before pulling out her camera and snapping a few pictures of the glorious figure."
4,img,"Marylin quickly tried to get across the barricades before the parade came, as otherwise, she would have been stuck inside the city, and the parade route, for the entire rest of the day. When she saw they were all closed, she sighed and resigned herself to a nearby cafe, pulling out her computer and slumping into a nearby chair as she went to order herself a coffee. The parade had just began to roll outside as she clicked furiously on her keys, trying to drown out the sounds of people yelling while she attempted to do her work."
5,real,"We walked down the stairs together. Dick said this was his favorite kind and nearly impossible to get. He is super impressed that I was able to get a bottle, even though I have never tried it. He says he will open it so I can try it. He will have some with me but then close it up and put it away,until he can find some more somewhere else. He opens the bottle and pours us each a small amount. I sip and agree that it is very good. He laughs and puts the top back on. He thanks me again and puts the bottle in the cabinet."
5,img,"Sue and I were out on the boat by ourselves in the afternoon when our husbands were at work. We had the dogs with us and let them swim beside the boat. Both had their life jackets on so we were able to lift them back into the boat. As Sue leaned over to lift her dog from the water, her necklace fell from her neck into the river. She grabbed at her neck but it was too late. The necklace was gone. She had tears in her eyes as she told me she'd been having problems with the clasp but though it was fixed."
6,real,"It was a hot summer day. Vicky, a coworker and dear friend, had invited me to her house for a cookout. When I got there, she greeted me at the door with a huge smile on her face. We sat in the kitchen and talked for a few minutes. Then we went outside to the patio and sat at a large picnic table that her husband had built. We watched her husband set up the grill. As he fired up the grill, I could smell the charcoal burning. It made me so hungry. We talked and laughed about things that had happened that week at work and played cards."
6,img,"Daniel and I went to the hospital to see a friend. It was our friend's birthday. We were going to surprise him with a birthday party to cheer him up. We had cake, presents, and balloons. When we entered his hospital room, his face lit up. He was happy to see us. A nurse came in to check his vital signs. She said, 'Wow, your visitors came to party today!' Daniel, being the flirt he is, offered the nurse some cake and told her she had very pretty eyes. She laughed and thanked him, but declined the offer. When she left, our friend said he'd get her number."
7,real,"Zoe, her son Jaxon, and I were hanging out in her front yard. She had just bought a trampoline and I was helping her set it up. Jaxon was running around continually asking whether it was ready. When we finished putting it together he happily jumped on and started bouncing. He was a bit nervous at first but as he got more confident he began landing on his back and doing flips. He bounce too close to the edge of the trampoline while trying to do a flip hit his face on the edge of the trampoline. He split is lip open, bleeding everywhere."
7,img,"Todd and I were in my front yard talking about movies when he asked me if I wanted to paint something, I said sure and went to get easels, canvas, paints, and brushes for us to paint. When I got back and set up the easels we talked about what we were going to paint, I did a painting of the front yard while he wouldn't tell me what he was painting. When we took a break I looked over at his canvass and saw a bizarre scene of reds, blacks, and purples. It looked liked an impressionist vision of the world being destroyed."
8,real,"During the last winter it was icy and snowy. We were trying not to track snow inside. We wear our work boots on the floor, but if it's lunch time we don't if we are in the break room. We had fans running in our break room because it gets warm for us. Rob came running in during lunch frantically waving around a bottle of water. He slipped on a wet patch and slid across the floor the water bottle flying into the air and hitting the fan. Exploding. Water went everywhere and we all just froze in place laughing trying to figure out the odds."
8,img,"We planned a trip to the beach for the summer and invited all our friends. The plan was to hang out, swim and eat and have a great time. We planned the trip for a weekend and packed and took off for a weekend of fun. We got there, unpacked, and decided it seemed like a great idea to go for a swim. So we all went and got ready and went to the beach. We turned around wondering where Rise was and there he was, running behind us carrying a blow up kids pool saying he was just going to swim in that."
9,real,"It was close to thanksgiving and my roommate Chauncey and I were enjoying the friendly get together our house had planned. Everyone was milling around drinking, smoking, and enjoying each other's company. Chauncey had made a cake for the party. It was red velvet which is one of my favorite kinds of cake. After dinner everyone had to take a bit of a pause before dessert. We played some games and socialized more, then we had the cake. It was wonderful and incredibly moist. I felt a real sense of closeness with Chauncey and my other roommates."
9,img,"Seth and I were at the local renaissance faire. We were dressed in fancy renaissance clothing and were walking around enjoying the entertainment and the crowds. We decided to find a show to watch. There were several events to choose from, including a play, a pie eating contest, and jousting. Both of us were most interested in the jousting event, so we headed over. We took our spot in the bleachers close to the jousting stage. It was fun to watch the performers, because they weren't using actual weapons, but pool noodles instead. The kids in the crowd thought it was funny."
10,real,"We were laying in bed chilling playing a truck game on her phone together taking turns passing the phone back and forth to see who could get the highest score. We did quite often, it was one of her favorite pastimes. We would usually play it for a hour or two, as far as I know it was the only game she played. She is kinda like me in that we don't really play games really. Afterwards we would talk or listen to music. The game really was not much fun but I played it with her cause she asked."
10,img,"Me and Christina would get in her car and go to parties on a regular. We once went diving in her car just listening to the music turned up loud with the top down going real fast and smoking weed. We were making jokes and having a great time. We stopped at the liquor store on the way back and get a bottle of Grey goose and some Hennessey. We went back to her place and me and her roommates drank, and danced to music. We played drinking games like beer pong."
11,real,"Ron called me over to his office right before lunch a week after I started and said he was taking me to lunch. We went out to the parking lot, got into his SUV and went to a Denny's nearby. It was mostly empty and we were waved to sit anywhere by a server. The sever brought menus and asked if we wanted drinks. Ron handed me a menu from the center of the table and looked at the one beneath it. It was sticky from some kind of food spill, and it was also on the menu he handed me. I had to leave to wash my hands."
11,img,"Cindy arrived at the Huntington Beach Gap parking lot a little while after I got there. I honked my horn to get her attention before I got out and started walking towards her. She said hello, and asked how I was doing. I was a little nervous about my part of the work on the business prospectus, so I said, 'mostly good.' She laughed. We sat at the bench and took out printed copies of each of our work to go over. There were several questions we needed answered, so we each highlighted those things on the printouts, and made notes. After 20 minutes we were satisfied and left."
12,real,"It was one of our first few dates together. We went down to the coast and walked through the oak tree forest together. We climbed these huge living oaks and hiked our way to view Jean Lafitte's grave. We then left the forest and went down to the shore and walked the beach while picking up litter and tar balls to dispose of. We took a break and rolled our pants up and stood in the surf, knee-high, and held each other. We knew in that moment how each other felt about the other, and didn't need to say a word."
12,img,"Sarah and her boyfriend came over to my apartment to hang out with me and my husband. We played games on the Switch. Then we were looking for a board game to play after a little while so we all went into the other room to dig through the our closet. Sarah's boyfriend Beau spotted my husband's guitars and immediately started swooning over them. He was saying how they were so gorgeous and he would love to play one for just a minute, since he hadn't played in years. My husband and my sister's boyfriend really hit it off."

14,real,"A month ago Portland had the biggest heat wave in our history. I have lived here all of my life and temperatures, even in summer, never get that hot. In fact, the air conditioner broke and we didn't even bother to repair it. That of course was a mistake. Last month temperatures got up to 116 degrees. This was an all time record since people have been keeping track of the temperatures and people were literally dying from heat stroke. My friend laura doesn't have AC either, but she does have a pool. So she called me over every day"
14,img,"Chuck came to town to visit. We went down memory lane since he was a friend from college and we went to college together here. We started by going to campus and walking around. We noticed all the things that were the same and different and we laughed as we remembered some specific events. Then we went to 7 11 where we used to eat all the time. We ate there because the food was so cheap and we could walk there from the dorm. On the way there, Chuck saw a car for sale and he bought it!"
15,real,"We were meeting in MD for Tommy's birthday celebration. We were anticipating meeting at the restaurant around 6:00 pm as we were driving from DE to meet him. We had other appointments that day so we left in the morning. Unfortunately, the bridge we were travelling over had been shut down due to someone threatening to jump off the bridge. We were stuck in traffic for a very long time. It ended up making us very late for dinner. However, once we arrived at dinner, we had a very nice celebration and a wonderful meal."
15,img,Joey and I had discussed taking a short trip to New Jersey as we were tired of the Delaware beaches and thought New Jersey would be a nice change. Joey had heard the waves might even be better. We ventured over to Lewes to take the ferry over to Cape May as we had heard their beaches were different. We arrived after two hours on the ferry and drove over to one of the beaches. We enjoyed our visit during the day and then went to find a seafood place to eat for dinner.
16,real,"Toni and I gathered at her house and started drinking. She ordered a pizza and had it delivered. Later on in the evening she invited a mutual friend over to enjoy the pizza together. We then started playing a card game together. During the card game the friend started flirting with Toni and one thing led to another and the friend whispered something to Toni in front of me. Toni blushed and said something in agreement. The friend then said he wanted to go lay down in her bed and did so. Toni said he wanted her to follow, so I said go for it, and she did."
16,img,"On a great vacation with me and Tucker we decided one night to go out and see some live music. We found a local bar that was going to have some local musicians playing. We drove to the bar and found a seat pretty close to the band. We sat right beside the keyboard of the group. We ordered drinks and some nachos to enjoy. We weren't sure what kind of music was going to be played, but as it turned out it was a mix of bands, some more low key while other's more loud and raucous. We really enjoyed the music."
17,real,"Betty showed me the snapshot first. It showed my Dad and me just after I was born. He was stretched out across the couch sound asleep with me snuggled into his chest, also asleep. She said it was always one of her favorite pictures. She then turned and pointed toward the wall to an enlargement of a picture of my Dad from about a year before he passed away. She told me that that was her favorite now, and that it makes her feel like he is still watching over her, and that they talk to each other every day."
17,img,"I have never enjoyed getting out on the water. However, Donna, lives for it. She has told me time and again to find her a boat. I have basically ignored her, which is never easy. I picked her up after she got off work, and we drove toward my Mom's house, but passed it by. It took her a few minutes to realize that we w ere headed for Lake Tyler. We drove to a small inlet.We stood there for a few minutes, just talking, and then a pontoon boat pulled up. My surprise to her for our anniversary."
18,real,"my long time best friend emma is horribly afraid of bugs of any kind. i know this because of previous simlar experiences i have had regarding this. we were in the drivethru of mcdonalds and i saw a giant spider coming down the web and was about to land directly on her. ii knew i couldn't tell her until we got into the drive through,, but when i did she flipped out so hard that she threw her car into drive and rearended the car in front of her. she pressed the gas hard and damaged the car pretty badly."

19,real,"NC wanted to go out to eat, and we went to a restaurant that was giving free meals to veterans for Veteran's Day. He used to be in the army. He brought his two year old daughter with him and we had a meal and chatted about life. His daughter got a little rambunctious and swept his plate off the table and it broke on the floor. He was apologetic to the staff, but they cooked him a new meal anyway and didn't charge him for the plate. That was all."
19,img,"We went to the park to hang out. When DS and I arrived, we got to talking and realized we didn't have a blanket in order to have lunch. I went into the trunk of my car and we found an old video game controller. As DS was looking at it, a duck swooped out of the sky and stole it. We chased after it, but the duck dropped it into the pond. We decided that it wasn't worth going in after the controller since it was probably full of dust and didn't work anyway."
20,real,We were having game night one night at my house. We were playing some kind of card game and we were sitting around the dining room table. We were laughing and having fun. Curtis got up from the table and got so excited about something and he jumped and farted and everyone started laughing so much. He ran off to the bathroom while the rest of us just laughed. He thought it was funny too. He came back to the table after and apologized but made jokes about it anyway. We went back to playing our card game.
20,img,Sabrina had come over one day to visit like she sometimes did. She would come by and hang out and see the kids. She was on her way out and she got into her car. She sat there for a while because she had a phone call. I guess she was distracted during the car because she had put the car into drive and she let off the brake and the car hit the neighbor's car in front of her in the street. The only reason I saw it was I used my security camera to see what the bang was.
21,real,"Renee and I went to an exhibit this spring where they had life sized reproductions of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel frescoes on display. We both majored in art history at the same school so we were excited to go. The weird thing was that the tickets were completely digital and stored in an app on our phones. This worried me because so much can go wrong with technology. But to get in, we had to open the app on our phones and the door person scanned a code. It worked and we got inside. It was a fun day."
21,img,"Ryan and I were at the mall, before covid, back when you could still go out and shop for things and have a normal life. We were browsing in Pottery Barn and Ryan found a chair that he really liked. It was a brown leather armchair with a quilted back and it was crazy expensive. He wanted it for his office but he knew we couldn't afford it. But he still sat in the chair and admired it. I agreed that it was a really great chair and I was sorry that we couldn't get it for his office."
22,real,"For the longest time, Janet didn't realize she was slowly reducing her dogs quality of life by feeding him a steady supply of fatty foods. Every meal made for her dog was curated with butter simply because he enjoyed it. None of the meal choices were selected by her vet. After a decade, her dog has developed chronic pancreatitis. Janet still disobeys her vets orders and feeds her dog fatty treats, like chips or cheese. The dog now lives a life where he doesn't know what type of food he's allowed to eat."
22,img,"Sue went to Kurt's house one day after hearing about his indoor garden. Sue has her own garden, but it's outdoors and the thought of any indoor garden was intriguing. Kurt has 2 spare rooms in his home, both taken up completely with vertical indoor garden. They're stacked and leveled, each with different plants and lighting. Sue was curious about the amount of harvest he's able to achieve on artificial lighting as opposed to her more 'natural' garden. After learning how much indoor growing reduces or completely eliminates insect damage, Sue decided to ask advice about starting her own indoor garden."
23,real,"Caleb was really concerned about the construction trailer for his business; after the day was over, he went out to the street where the trailer was parked and took a long hard look around. He assessed whether or not this was a safe area to leave his trailer. Everything inside dictated his livelihood. His entire business was inside that trailer, his family depends on the income, their mortgage payment is reliant on him being able to run a successful construction business. After taking a long hard look around the neighborhood, and then assuring himself that every lock was locked and every block was in the right place, he felt fine."
23,img,"Jon was worried about moving to Sweden. Being in a new country is hard, especially when you don't really know anyone there. He was moving there after having spent most of his life in America. He would be doing the same thing, working with his hands. He was promised by his hiring company in his new country that every tool he would need would be available to him. Jon is a skilled craftsman, he can make anything. As Jon booked the flight, he sat back, relaxed and waited for the airplane comm system to tell him that they were arriving in his new home country."
24,real,Justin unveiled his brands new game console to us at his house in Millville and we were amazed at how nice it looked. I wanted to play the first game he showed us but after going through his collection I chose a game everyone would enjoy playing. He disagreed with me at first but gave in eventually. The house was packed with people that day as he had family members visiting so things go a bit noisy at times. Still we enjoyed playing the game and then played some of the other games as well that he had.
24,img,Karen and I went to Sommerville because she was dying to purchase this fancy turtle necklace that one of the stores there had. I was bored that day so I went along for the ride. The city was full of people with a lot of commotion all around. It took us a while to park too. Afterwards he walked several blocks because we weren't sure exactly where the store was. Eventually someone pointed us to its location and we entered the store. The necklace was there and Karen scooped it up right away and paid for it. It was rather pricey but at least she was happy.
25,real,"Natalie and I went on a Caribbean cruise. It was a fabulous time. A time for mother and daughter. We had a room with a balcony, which cost a little more, but it was worth it. It was my first cruise. When we arrived in the room it was decorated with a lot of things hanging from the ceiling. Also a special towel just for me. I learned afterwards that she had bought this package as a welcome gift for me because it was my first cruise. I treasure that towel to this day."
25,img,"Dica invited me to his house. I had no idea why she invited me there, but I went because it was something that I wanted to do. I always enjoyed her company. When I was there, the subject of cars came up. She knew I needed a car because mine was really causing me problems. We talked about it and she said she had a surprise for me. When he came home, she seemed pretty excited, so I was anticipating something special. They took me outside and presented me with a car. They were giving it to me because I needed it so badly."
26,real,"My best friend Chris and I used to play Frisbee on the beach in North California with our friends. We would surf with the gang until it got dark, then play Frisbee under the stars. There was a group of us college students who hung out during the spring, summer and fall. Chris was the best player and most athletic of all of us. He would have his little brother go very far out and throw the Frisbee as far as he could. It surprises me to this day how far he could make it go."
26,img,"My friend Evan and I were in my kitchen, talking about the new job he had got. I worked for an audit company, and had been trying to get him on. Evan was a fast worker, but hadn't had a full-time job before. He had helped my dad off and on through college. Evan was very adept with computers and technology, and I knew he would be fast on the audits, since our primary tool was a scanner. He was great with technology, and would be able to enter the accounting information into the scanner quickly and accurately."
27,real,Nick and I went out after not seeing each other for about thirty years. We me up at my place first and talked for a while. We went for dinner and he had vodka and I drank beer and we ate burgers. We went back to my place. We decided to get an Uber and do a bar crawl. We went to each of the nearby gay bars. I drank gin drinks at every bar we went to. I drank a lot. We came back to my place. Nick spent the night in the guest room. I threw up the gin that I had been drinking.
27,img,Bob was in the hospital for a stomach surgery. It was very near my apartment so I drove him. I took him to the hospital. l grabbed some lunch and went shopping. I went home. The phone rang and it was the nurse. She said I could come and get Bob. I drove to the hospital. They called me to come back to where Bob was. I went to the recovery area and sat by Bob's bed. He was sort of conscious. He was very high and goofy. He was drooling and laughing at the drool. I took a picture of him like that.
28,real,"I was visiting Kevin's farm in Perry, Kansas. We both decided to go drive to one of his cow pastures to check on the health of all his cattle there. We decided to take the Jeep, since it maneuvered nicely over the bumpy rocks and hilly terrain of the pasture. All the cattle looked big, strong, and healthy until we came upon a cow with her newborn baby calf. The cow's eyes were both so red and inflamed that we couldn't even see any color but red in both her eyes. We immediately put her in a trailer and took her to the local veterinarian."
28,img,"Steve and I were sunbathing on Galveston Island beach. The weather was cold, but we didn't care because we both had the day off, we wanted to spend the day together, and even though it was rather chilly, the sun was shining brightly that day. As we were lying on our beach towels, both of us slipping in and out of light naps, the craziest thing happened. A child threw a beach ball right at us which was covered with seaweed and tons of little bugs. The bugs started biting both of us. It wasn't funny then, but now I can laugh about it."
29,real,Mike was at a baseball game watching his favorite major league team with a group of his friends. This was one of his favorite things to do during the summer months and he went to games whenever he could. On this particular night the weather was very warm and muggy. During the fifth inning of the game he went to the refreshment stand to get a cold cup of beer to drink and cool off. While walking back to his seat a player at bat hit a foul ball which Mike did not see and it flew up into the stands and landed right in his cup of beer.
29,img,Steve went to the card game at our friend Mikes house and while playing pot limit Texas Hold'em he was having a pretty rough night. He was drawing decent cards but getting beat all night on the river card (last card shown) and was getting extremely frustrated. As the night went on he kept losing on these hands and was losing more and more money even though he was playing the cards right and could do nothing different in the way he was playing. After getting beat one more time he left the table and grabbed a hockey puck from a display and threw it and broke a window.
30,real,"Mike and I decided it would be a nice day to go for a hike. I grabbed a backpack and filled it with a sweatshirt, bottles of water, a first-aid kit, and a few snacks. We climbed the path at the entrance which has a sharp incline. We reached the first juncture with several paths to choose from and Mike noticed a trail that was not labelled or marked. He wanted to go down this mystery path. I was hesitant but agreed. The path was not maintained and rocky. It was challenging and somewhat dangerous but it was a fun trail to take."
30,img,"Taylor told me he didn't like to exercise and that his doctor wanted him to start exercising to help manage his blood pressure. I suggested that biking would be a good way to start exercising. Taylor didn't want to try anything too difficult so we went to the local recreation center that has a small, flat bike path that goes around the facility. We set a goal to make it around the path 5 times. Taylor struggled. Our first lap around went well but Taylor started to struggle. By the fourth lap he had difficulties breathing and decided to stop before we could reach our goal."
31,real,"The last time I went out on the boat with Ted was about a year ago. It was spur of the moment and something that neither of us planned. I went over to his house early in the morning for coffee and he mentioned that it would be a great day to be out on the river. One thing lead to another and before we knew it, we were hitching up the boat and headed out to the river. It was a great day and we both had a great time doing something we love."
31,img,"Jay came over to grill up some ribs on the barbeque for us. It was a really sunny, hot day with a light breeze; the kind perfect for a get-together with friends. It was late afternoon when he came over and started to cook the dinner. There were about 10 of us gathered, many who knew each other. Some of us sat around the table laughing and talking about old times, while some of us played a game of croquet on the lawn. It was around 10pm when everyone left and went home."
32,real,"My brother Mike had purchased a used lawn mower for his own personal use, as he has a large lawn. Shortly after the purchase, he began to have problems getting it to start. I went over one day to his garage where he was working on the lawn mower. We spent the afternoon trying to figure out what the issue was with the mower. I used my phone to do some internet research of possible causes of the problem. We eventually concluded that it was probably the ignition switch, and after a brief trip to the local parts shop, we got a new switch installed and it worked perfectly."
32,img,"Last December, a few days before Christmas, my friend Gerard stopped by my house to visit. We hadn't seen each other in awhile, and it was nice to see him again. I had purchased a brand new video game for him as a Christmas present a few days prior and he had already downloaded and started playing it by the time he visited me. When he came in, he had a long, narrow present wrapped in bright green and blue wrapping paper. I was surprised and pleased to find a new fishing rod inside. Gerard knew I liked to go fishing and came up with the perfect gift."
